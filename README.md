Mineworld is a project made just for fun by VroenVen, that was edited (and is being ported by) Saladin (also known as asdf2jkl.)

TI-BASIC files are perfectly functional, albeit no longer supported, but the axe code is done, and just about to be released.

Whenever editing a file's source, please try to update the .8xp version of the code in order to keep the files up to date. (if not, that's ok too, it may just take longer for me to process because I'll need to compile it.)

Compiling: You will need MENUS.8xv and the Axe parser on the calculator in order to compile the AXE version. In addition, in order to read the description/see the icon, you will need to compile for the shell that you use (please note that shell versions do not work on stock TI-OS, and that the Application and AXE Fusion options do not compile properly)

The Axe Parser can be found here: https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/456/45659.html

Things being worked on (in no particular order):

#1 AXE may get grayscale options

#2 AXE is getting world wrap options

#3 AXE needs to be able to scroll left

#4 AXE needs a save/load feature

#5 Possible port to html/js or c/c++

#6 Should 2 or 3 be the default game speed, opinions are needed
