Mineworld is a project made just for fun by VroenVen, that was edited (and is being ported by) Saladin (also known as asdf2jkl.)

TI-BASIC files are perfectly functional, but the axe code is in a pre-alpha state (it doesn't really work.)

Whenever editing a file's source, please try to update the .8xp version of the code in order to keep the files up to date.

Known issues:
#1 TI-BASIC crashes when placing a block offscreen
#2 AXE is really messed up
