Mineworld is a project made just for fun by VroenVen, that was edited (and is being ported by) Saladin (also known as asdf2jkl.)

TI-BASIC files are perfectly functional, but the axe code is in an alpha state (it's still in development)

Whenever editing a file's source, please try to update the .8xp version of the code in order to keep the files up to date. (if not, that's ok too, it may just take longer for me to process because I'll need to compile it.)

Known issues:

#1 AXE has massive cliffs generated because of some sort of overflow error

#2 AXE will not increase height by more than 2 pixels, but can decrece height between columns by seven.

Things being worked on:

#3 AXE needs to have character support added

#4 TI-Basic needs towers added

#5 AXE needs proper seeds as similar to TI-BASIC as possible

#6 AXE needs a menu system

#7 ALL VERSIONS should have scrolling screens

#8 AXE needs a save/load feature

#9 Possible port to html, 84+ ce, or Nspire
