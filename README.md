Mineworld is a project made just for fun by VroenVen, that was edited (and is being ported by) Saladin (also known as asdf2jkl.)

TI-BASIC files are perfectly functional, but the axe code is in an alpha state (it's still in development)

Whenever editing a file's source, please try to update the .8xp version of the code in order to keep the files up to date.

Known issues:
#1 TI-BASIC crashes when placing a block offscreen

#2 AXE has massive cliffs generated because of some sort of overflow error

#3 AXE will not increase height by more than 2 pixels, but can decrece height between columns by seven.
